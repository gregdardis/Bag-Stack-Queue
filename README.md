# Description
This program contains Singly Linked List implementations of three data structures: a bag, a stack, and a queue. All three implementations have iterator methods that can be used to iterate through the content of the data structures.

The bag has methods to get its size, check if it's empty or not, and add an item. There is no method for removing an item from the bag in this implementation.

The stack has methods to get its size, check if it's empty or not, push an item onto the stack, and pop the most recently added item off the stack (last in, first out).

The queue has methods to get its size, check if its empty or not, add an item to the end of the queue (enqueue), and get an item from the start of the queue (dequeue) (first in, first out).

Unit testing done for all three classes using JUnit. 

Bag.java, Queue.java, and Stack.java all contain `main()` methods that print simple demonstrations to the console.
