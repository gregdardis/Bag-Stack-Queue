# Description
This program contains Singly Linked List implementations of a three data structures - a bag, a stack, and a queue.  All three implementations have an iterator method which can be used to iterate through the content of the data structure.  

The bag has methods to get it's size, if it's empty or not, and to add an item to the bag. There is no method for removing an item from the bag in my implementation.  

The stack has methods to get it's size, if it's empty or not, to push an item onto the stack, and to pop the most recently added item off the stack (last in first out).  

The queue has methods to get it's size, if it's empty or not, to add an item to the end of the queue (enqueue) and to get an item from the start of the queue (dequeue) (first in first out).
